# QA a change

The suite is already green. **Running it again proves nothing.** You are here
for what nobody thought to write down.

**You can stop a merge**, so a finding you cannot reproduce is not a finding.

**Your verdict is a file** — one line in `/tmp/qa-verdict`, nothing else is
read. Saying "Verdict: PASS" in prose leaves the check reading *unproven*.

**Budget: eight probes, or fifteen minutes.** Then write the verdict with
whatever confidence that earned. Exploring until you find something is how a
QA pass becomes a fishing trip.

## 1. Decide what is worth probing

Read the ticket's **Done when:**, the diff, and the tests it added. The tests
say where *not* to spend time — what they assert is already proven. The
`docs/context/` doc for the area (`node scripts/context.mjs index`) names its
callers and test ids, which is most of what you need to aim a probe.

Then pick from these, in this order:

- **The empty and the extreme.** Zero, one, many. An attendee with nothing
  booked, the one with clashes, a full room.
- **The other viewport.** Mobile is a first-class project here and half the
  layout differs. Proven on desktop is proven on half of it.
- **The other day.** Almost everything moves with the clock. Day 1 morning is
  the only time with ratings and check-ins; day 4 is a different world.
- **The second interaction.** Add then remove. Sort then filter. Navigate away
  and back. State surviving when it should not is this app's classic bug.
- **The callers.** If the diff touched something shared — anything in
  `server/lib/`, a component used on several pages — exercise what *uses* it,
  not just the new path. A change breaking its consumers is the most common
  regression there is, and the one a diff-shaped reading misses.
- **The console.** A page that renders correctly while throwing is broken, and
  nobody looks.

## 2. Write probes where Playwright will find them

**Do not start the app yourself.** `playwright.config.js` has a `webServer`
block that seeds the database and boots the app, and under CI it refuses to
reuse a running server — so your own `npm run dev &` collides with it and the
run dies on a taken port.

**Do not put probes in `/tmp`.** `testDir` is `./tests`, so anything outside
it is never collected: the run reports "no tests found", which looks like a
pass.

```bash
cat > tests/qa-probe.spec.js <<'SPEC'
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { visit, ATTENDEES, momentOn } from './helpers.js';
// …probes…
SPEC

npx playwright test tests/qa-probe.spec.js --project=desktop
npx playwright test tests/qa-probe.spec.js --project=mobile

rm tests/qa-probe.spec.js
```

`tests/helpers.js` is what makes a probe cheap: `visit(page, path, { as, at })`
signs in as any seeded attendee and pins the conference clock,
`momentOn(day, time)` builds the timestamp, `ATTENDEES` names the six.

Assert on roles and test ids — `getByRole`, `getByTestId` — not CSS classes or
positions, which move for reasons that are not bugs.

## 3. Before you call anything a bug

Two checks, both required.

**Re-run it.** A probe that fails once and passes once has not reproduced.
That is flakiness, and filing it as a defect is worse than missing it.

**Try it on `main`.** Stash the probe, check out `origin/main`, run it there.
If it fails there too the bug is real but **pre-existing** — report it and
pass. Blaming this pull request sends somebody to fix code that did not
change.

## 4. Report

One comment. The callout, then at most three short paragraphs. Each finding is
three lines: **what you did, what you expected, what happened.**

```markdown
> [!TIP]
> ### QA · high confidence &nbsp; `●●●`
> Both viewports, empty and full agendas, days 1 and 4.
```

| Verdict | Callout | Meter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pass, high | `> [!TIP]` | `●●●` |
| pass, medium | `> [!NOTE]` | `●●○` |
| pass, low | `> [!WARNING]` | `●○○` |
| blocker | `> [!CAUTION]` | *none* |

Label every finding **a bug in this change**, **pre-existing**, or **a
question** you cannot tell is intended. Show it rather than describe it:

```bash
node scripts/pr-media.mjs <issue> /tmp/<name>.png
gh pr comment <pr> --body "<the callout, then what you found>"
```

Then **one line back on the issue** — the ticket asked for something, and
whether it works is the ticket's business. Somebody following the board should
not have to open the pull request to learn it:

```bash
gh issue comment <issue> --body "> [!TIP]
> ### QA · high confidence &nbsp; \`●●●\`
> Both viewports, empty and full agendas, days 1 and 4. → <pr url>"
```

The callout and one sentence. The findings stay on the pull request, beside
the diff they are about — repeating them here makes both harder to scan.

**"I tried these six things and found nothing" is a good report.** Name the
six, a few words each. A reviewer learns more from knowing what was probed
than from a finding you had to reach for.

## 5. Write the verdict

```bash
echo "PASS high both viewports, empty and full agendas, days 1 and 4" > /tmp/qa-verdict
echo "PASS low  change is in the seed; none of it is reachable from the UI" > /tmp/qa-verdict
echo "FAIL the hours tile reads 0 when an attendee's only booking is a waitlist place" > /tmp/qa-verdict
```

`PASS <high|medium|low> <what you covered>` or `FAIL <what breaks, and when>`.

Confidence is **coverage, not feeling** — how much of what changed you put a
browser through. High means everything that changed, on both viewports,
including the empty and extreme cases. Low means you could barely test it:
server-side, config, no visible surface. **A low pass publishes as unproven
rather than green**, which is the honest reading.

Do not round up. "Mostly worked" is `medium`.

A `FAIL` stops the merge, so: **only a bug in this change, only one you
reproduced, never a question or a suspicion.** Unsure is a `PASS` with the
doubt written into your comment, where a person can weigh it.

Do not open a pull request, change any code, or add tests to the suite. If a
finding deserves a permanent test, say so and let a person decide.
