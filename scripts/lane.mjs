 * Several agents can work several tickets at once, each in its own

 * hands out a free consecutive pair and records the claim where every
 * worktree can see it.
 *
 * The registry lives in the *common* git directory. Linked worktrees each get
 * their own `.git`, but `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` resolves to the same
 * path from inside all of them — so a lock written by one lane is visible to
 * every other, with no daemon, no config file and no machine-wide state. It
 * also disappears when the repo does.
 *
 * `ORBIT_DB` is deliberately not part of a lane: `data/` is gitignored and
 * per-checkout, so every worktree already seeds its own database.
