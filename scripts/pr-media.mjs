 * Several files in one call, because the agent pays per step and a before and
 * an after are one thought, not two.
 *
 * A reviewer looking at a UI change wants to see the UI. GitHub only renders
 * an image it is hosting, and the web upload that normally provides that is a
 * browser drag-and-drop — no API, so an agent cannot use it.
 *
 * What it can do is commit the file. Images live on a `pr-media` branch that
 * is never merged and never branched from, so they are servable by URL
 * without appearing in anybody's diff or reaching `main`.
 *
 * On a private repository only github.com URLs render, because they carry the
 * reader's session. `raw.githubusercontent.com` returns 404 to a browser and
 * the image silently breaks, so this prints the `/raw/` form.
 *
 * This exists as a script rather than a few lines in the ship playbook because
 * an agent pays for every step it takes: one command that always works costs
 * less than four that have to be got right.
